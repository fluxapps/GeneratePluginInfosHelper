# __NAME__ Library for ILIAS Plugins

__SHORT_DESCRIPTION__

This is an OpenSource project by studer + raimann ag, CH-Burgdorf (https://studer-raimann.ch)

This project is licensed under the __LICENSE__ license

## Usage

### Composer
First add the following to your `composer.json` file:
```json
"require": {
  "__NAME__": ">=1.0.0"
},
```
And run a `composer install`.

If you deliver your plugin, the plugin has it's own copy of this library and the user doesn't need to install the library.

Tip: Because of multiple autoloaders of plugins, it could be, that different versions of this library exists and suddenly your plugin use an older or a newer version of an other plugin!

So I recommand to use [srag/librariesnamespacechanger](https://packagist.org/packages/srag/librariesnamespacechanger) in your plugin.
